**Briefly about how it works**

API contains 5 endpoints

**1. start_new_game** - hitting it user creates a new game table with basic properties in it (see `./models/gameModel.js` ).

Also in this endpoint dealer shuffles the card deck and deals the first cards for the player and dealer. Order matters. 

So the first and the third card goes to the dealer, and the second and fourth cards go to the player's hand. (see `./services/cardService.js` func `dealTwoCardsForDealerAndPlayer`)

**2. submit_player_hit** - hitting this one, the player asks for an extra card. 

The service also updates the game state according to changes the new card can bring to the game. (see `./services/cardService.js` -- `isPlayerHandBust, dealCardForPerson, getCardScore`).

**3. submit_dealer_hit** - pretty similar to the previous one but for the dealer. 

This endpoint is hitting when the dealer opens the hand and figures out that his hand is lower 17 or is "Soft 17".
To continue the round dealer needs to take extra cards until his score is 17 or more. (see `./services/cardService.js` -- `hasDealerCompleteHand, isDealerHandBust`)

**4. submit_player_stay** - this endpoint reveals the dealer's hand and does a couple of checks for dealer bust/dealer low hand / compare score / declare winner. 

Service also scores aces with a check for the best possible score to avoid a bust. (see `./services/cardService.js` -- `getTheFinalPlayerScoreToCompare`)

**5.  get_game_details** - the name says about its nature. During the round, we need to know how each event affects the game state.

The service is now deployed at https://black-jack-api.onrender.com/game/ -- feel free to play with it in postman or browser.
